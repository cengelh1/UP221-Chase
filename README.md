# Hello There!

## Profile
Hi Y'all, my name is Chase (he/him) and I'm a first year MURP Student. I did an undergrad degree in International Politics at UC Santa Cruz and later moved to South America for 3 years (mostly Chile and Peru). While there worked on a wide range of urban issues including, environmental education, coastal conservation, waste management, transportation justice, urban farming, and caceral justice. Once back in the States I went to work with Safe Place for Youth, a homeless service provider for young people in Los Angeles, where I worked to start advocacy groups consisting of young people experiencing homelessness, as well as volunteer organizers. Most recently I have been working at Climate Resolve doing policy analysis and community organizing on issues of Housing, transportation, and land use as they relate to climate inequities in Los Angeles.

For fun, I like to make music, surf, get outside, travel, and explore cities.

## About This Course
The work from this course demonstrates:
  -The value of data for planning purposes through discovery, exploration, and analysis
  
  -Critical evaluation of data and create frameworks to prepare data for research
  
  -Application of data science programming techniques to produce relevant visualizations that inform urban policy
  
  -Visualization of data spatially to communicate the importance of place-based informatics
  
  -Production of publication-ready scholarly materials in the form of tables, charts, and maps
  
## Project Ideas
I am interested in exploring how to visualize the impacts of the housing/jobs imbalance, concentrations of air pollution, better visusalizing the high injury network, potential sites for social housing/CLTs, and better visually demonstrating racial inequities and segregation accross LA. 
  
## Course Objective
I hope to gain a firm understanding of Python in this course, as well as more proficiently work with data tools. 

Looking forward to working with y'all!
