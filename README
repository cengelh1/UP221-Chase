# Hello There!

Hi Y'all, my name is Chase (he/him) and I'm a first year MURP Student. I did an undergrad degree in International Politics at UC Santa Cruz and later moved to South America for 3 years (mostly Chile and Peru). While there worked on a wide range of urban issues including, environmental education, coastal conservation, waste management, transportation justice, urban farming, and caceral justice. Once back in the States I went to work with Safe Place for Youth, a homeless service provider for young people in Los Angeles, where I worked to start advocacy groups consisting of young people experiencing homelessness, as well as volunteer organizers. Most recently I have been working at Climate Resolve doing policy analysis and community organizing on issues of Housing, transportation, and land use as they relate to climate inequities in Los Angeles.

For fun, I like to make music, surf, get outside, travel, and explore cities.
